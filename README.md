# Pose Estimation Game üéÆ

A **Pose Estimation Game** built using **Python**, **Pygame**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**. This project combines fitness and fun by leveraging pose estimation technology to provide interactive gameplay and real-time feedback.

## Features üåü

### Main Functionalities:
- **Instructions**: Clear guidance on how to play the game.
- **Settings**: 
  - Adjust background music volume.
  - Modify sound effect volume.
- **Exit**: Seamlessly exit the game from the menu.
